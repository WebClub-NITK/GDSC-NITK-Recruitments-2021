## Task ID: Remote Code Execution Engine
#### `web development`

Mentors: [@AdarshNaidu](https://github.com/AdarshNaidu) (+91 8618773543), [@GunukulaNiharika](https://github.com/GunukulaNiharika) (+91 9014873349)

Tag: `Hard`

### Description
Remote Code execution engine (RCEE) allows users to run their code submitted through an API request in a secure environment. There are many popular services like Leetcode, GeeksForGeeks, code playgrounds, online compilers/interpreters, etc. that have implemented their own versions of RCEE using different architectures.

Your task is to build a remote code execution engine and a web application, through which users can submit a code snippet in the language of their choice, run it, and view the output after execution. Things to consider: latency, security, isolation.

Example: https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/

### Description
[Editor.js](https://editorjs.io/) is an open source library that allows us to easily integrate a text editor in our web applications. It’s a “block styled” editor, i.e. it creates separate blocks for different elements that can be included in the editor. It also allows us to create custom plugins or tools using which we can add our own blocks to the editor. Currently to include code examples in the editor, there is an official tool available at https://github.com/editor-js/code. But it does not support language selection, and syntax highlighting. This task involves creating a similar plugin which supports these features
